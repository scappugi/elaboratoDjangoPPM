Recipe Sharing Website:
Create a recipe sharing website where users can share and discover new recipes. Implement features
like recipe creation, recipe searching, and recipe favoriting. The model complexity can involve defining
relationships between users, recipes, and categories. The templates can focus on displaying recipe
details and providing a clean interface for users to browse and search for recipes.
